# Integration Guide

This integration guide will enable access to the preview and mainnet deployments via accessing our hosted API service. If you would like to setup and host the application yourself please make sure to read the [winter-manual](../setup/requirements) and the [best-practices](../deployment/local) documents instead.

## Staging vs Production

Staging refers to accessing the Cardano **preview** network while production refers to accessing the Cardano **mainnet** network. Unfortunately, we currently do not have any publically available API to access. The preview network will use test ADA while mainnet uses real ADA.
