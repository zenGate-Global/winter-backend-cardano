# Cost Reduction Techniques

A basic way to use the protocol is to create a tokenization event for each traceability event that occurs in the physical world. However, due to the minting cost requirements of the Cardano blockchain, it may become too expensive to do so.

In order to reduce minting and transaction costs, adjust the IPFS metadata template so that the structure can reflect a collection of traceability events instead of just one.

To implement the batching process, it is sufficient to create a CRON job that will read from a database the events that you wish to tokenize, and then make the appropriate API request to the application service.
