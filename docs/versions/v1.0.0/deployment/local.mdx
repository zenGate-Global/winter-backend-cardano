# Local Deployment

This is a document outlining some best-practices for getting the project setup locally or within a hosted environment.

It is important to note that the current version is an MVP/PoC meant to be integrated within another application, and not meant to be used as a standalone service.

## Setup

Local deployment is used for development and testing any changes made.

- It is recommended to use Docker for running the project locally instead of build and running it with npm/yarn/bun.
- Make sure to provide a valid PORT number as an environment variable for the application to listen to incoming requests.
