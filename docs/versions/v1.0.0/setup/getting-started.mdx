# Getting Started

In order to proceed with installing and running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

[git](https://git-scm.com): This is necessary to clone the GitHub repository.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com): The application is containerized, so Docker will be required to build the image and then run it.

[Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com): This will be necessary to make API calls to the application.

## Installation

Clone the repository on your computer:

`git clone https://github.com/zenGate-Global/winter-backend-cardano`

## Running the Application

Once all the environment variables have been properly set, you can use the following command to build and then run the image:

`docker compose up --build`
