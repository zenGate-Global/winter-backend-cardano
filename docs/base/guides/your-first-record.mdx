Getting Started with Winter Protocol: Tokenizing Your First Blockchain Record

In this guide, we walk you through testing and creating your first blockchain event using Winter Protocol. It's a straightforward process with three key API calls to build and secure records on the blockchain.

<Alert variant="info" title="Preview Network">
We focus on the preview instance for simplicity. If you're ready to self-host, head over to the Setup section for details.
</Alert>

Winter Protocol lets you tokenize real-world assets or data securely, leveraging IPFS for storage and Cardano for immutable transactions. It's designed for versatility, whether you're handling commodities, documents, or custom payloads.

<Alert variant="warning" title="Testnet Recommended">
Use the Preview (testnet) network for learning and development. These records live on the Cardano preview network. For mainnet use or scaling, see the Technical FAQs.
</Alert>

The core endpoints we use are:
- `/ipfs` for uploading to IPFS
- `/palmyra/tokenizeCommodity` for blockchain attachment
- `/check` for status tracking

## Step 1: Upload Your Payload to IPFS

Start by creating a simple payload to tokenize. Winter Protocol supports any data type, but keep it lightweight for efficiency.

For this example, we tokenize a basic message:

```json
{
  "message": "hello world"
}
```

Set up a new POST request to the `/ipfs` endpoint. Switch the body to JSON and paste in your payload.

The response should give you an IPFS hash:

```json
{
  "hash": "bafkreihznwgtov7pgilkv6lxrycivkxqqa6i7mwjl2rpyzoeqlllqqzqcu"
}
```

This hash is your data's permanent address on IPFS.

<Alert variant="info" title="Payload Format">
JSON is required. Make sure your payload is properly formatted. Use tools like JSON Formatter to verify it.
</Alert>

## Step 2: Tokenize the Record on the Blockchain

Next, attach that IPFS record to a Cardano blockchain transaction. Use the `/palmyra/tokenizeCommodity` POST endpoint.

Your payload needs a token name and the IPFS reference, prefixed with `ipfs://`:

```json
{
  "tokenName": "My first token",
  "metadataReference": "ipfs://bafkreihznwgtov7pgilkv6lxrycivkxqqa6i7mwjl2rpyzoeqlllqqzqcu"
}
```

Send this to the `/palmyra/tokenizeCommodity` endpoint in the body as JSON. The response will include your Winter Protocol ID.

This ID confirms the tokenization request is queued.

## Step 3: Check the Token Status and Verify on Blockchain

Track progress with the `/check` GET endpoint: `/check/{id}`, swapping in your ID.

The response shows status like "queued," "minted," or "failed." Once minted, you can verify on the blockchain.

To verify, use a Cardano Preview explorer like [preview.cardanoscan.io](https://preview.cardanoscan.io). Plug in the transaction hash and confirm your token is live on the blockchain, timestamped forever.

That's it. You've tokenized your first record. Winter Protocol's flexibility means you can adapt this for apps, from asset tracking to data provenance.
