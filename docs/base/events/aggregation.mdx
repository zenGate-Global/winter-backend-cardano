# Aggregation

## Aggregation Event

This represents an aggregation event where objects are placed inside or grouped together. The data input(s) are the objects that are being physically aggregated.

An example would be when separate tea lots are placed in a shipping container.

## Disaggregation Event

This represents a disaggregation event where objects are being removed from the grouping. The data input(s) represent the aggregated object.

An example would be when tea lots are separated from a shipping container.
