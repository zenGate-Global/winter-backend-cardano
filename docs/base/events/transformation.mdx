# Transformation

This represents where objects are physically transformed into new objects. The data inputs represents the objects that will be transformed.

For example, consider mixing batter and chocolate chips into cookie dough, then baking the dough into a batch of cookies. Once the ingredients are "transformed", the resulting product is packaged and labeled with an EAN or UPC that represents "consumer package of chocolate chip cookies" and can be scanned at retail.
