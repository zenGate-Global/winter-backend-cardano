# Association

This represents an association event where objects are physically associated with a parent object. The data inputs represent the objects being associated to the parent object.

A scenario could be sensors which are physically attached to the containers or pallets of tea and associated with a specific warehouse location. These sensors continuously monitor conditions and report data, ensuring the quality of the tea is maintained during storage and that inventory levels can be accurately tracked.
