# Introduction

Welcome to the Winter Backend Cardano documentation. This application provides a comprehensive solution for blockchain-based traceability using the Cardano network.

Winter Backend Cardano enables you to:

- Upload traceability metadata to IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System)
- Tokenize data references on the Cardano blockchain
- Update existing tokenized references
- Delete (burn) tokenized references when no longer needed

The application exposes a REST API for interacting with the Cardano blockchain, handling all the complexity of transaction building and submission.
